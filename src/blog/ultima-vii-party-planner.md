![The Exult form loved it.][pic-1]

In an effort to learn more about [backbone.js][link-1] I made a web application that is easily
considered beautifully useless (beauty in the eye of the beholder, useless in the eye of everyone
else). Really, this is probably one of the finest work of code writing I've accomplished to date and
there are maybe ten people in the world who will use it.
