lack of strait forward documentation

- windows account?
signing into a microsoft account took over my local account and I couldn't log in becuase I use a password manaer

- why do I have to reinstall?
3 times so February

- security
I don't really have to complain here, other people got it covered

- subscription windows games? really?

- still suffer from paths that are too long problems? [node-modules kill it]

why is the address bar in edge not aparent?



what I do like
snap to corners! finally
no driver issues
two finger scroll


meh
flat square ui
