History
-------
### Prairie View A&M <small>_Bachelors in Computer Science/Research Assistant_ **2012 - 2016**</small>

I lead my senior design team to build a web based multi-player space combat game. The server side
was Node.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB; while the client side used Phaser.io for the game engine along
with the usual Bootstrap and jQuery to make it pretty.

As a research assistant I built a ticket system to help the Provost's Office process student
requests. It was made with an MVC (Backbone.js), a PHP API (Slim), and a ton of documentation
because someone else would be taking it over.

While working for the [Cloud Computing Research Group][1] I made a web interface to spare image
processing users from the command line. The backend was a Hadoop Cluster and we visualized the data
with D3.

### Hewlett Packard Enterprise <small>_Software Development Internship_ **Summer of 2015**</small>

I was part of a crack team of interns that pulled a bunch of complicated data from multiple
databases and visualized it in the coolest way possible. This was the first time I made extensive
use of Visual Studios and the .NET Framework. It has it's pros and cons.

I also setup a Wiki for internal documentation saving employee's time because it was quick for
finding information and easy to maintain. It was the first time I set up PHP on IIS, and used a
MSSQL database instead of MySQL. They really like Microsoft at HP.

### L3 Communications <small>_Software Development Internship_ **Summer of 2013**</small>

I got this internship because I already knew Linux and Git. Every morning I drove past Rocket park
to build a user friendly interface that tested the on-board computer of the [Orion Multi-Purpose
Crew Vehicle][2], making life a little easier for some NASA engineers. It was so cool.

It was also my first experience with Node.js and I used so much jQuery I no longer have to look up
how to use most methods.

### Lone Star University <small>_Student_ **2010 - 2011**</small>

Graduated in May 2011, _summa cum laude_. I hope they don't take it away for having to look up what
it meant.

### Sidtek, L.L.C. <small>_Head Computer Repair Technician_ **2003 - 2008**</small>

My role was to make sure customers were satisfied and the company profited. There was a lot of
troubleshooting involved--ran into many interesting problems. Learned I enjoy helping people more
than fixing computers.

### United States Marine Corps <small>_Sergeant - Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare Defense Specialist_ **1998 - 2003**</small>

Teaching fellow Marines to [survive in contaminated environments][3] was an important and rewarding
role.
